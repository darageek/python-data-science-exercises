# Python Data Science Exercises

This repository contains a collection of programming exercises completed as part of my personal learning journey through an online Python for Data Science course. The aim is to consolidate foundational concepts in Python programming, data analysis, and scientific computing.

## üìÅ Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing fully documented exercises, code, and explanations.
- Each notebook is dedicated to a specific topic or section from the course.

## üöÄ Getting Started
You can clone the repository and open the notebooks using Jupyter:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-data-science-exercises.git
cd python-data-science-exercises
jupyter notebook
```
Ensure you have Anaconda installed in your environment.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This repository contains my own original solutions to programming exercises inspired by a course I am currently undertaking. It does not include any proprietary course materials, instructor-provided solutions, or copyrighted content.
